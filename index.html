        <h1>You will get to know all about Laptop Companies history</h1>
        <h3>Laptop computers, also known as notebooks, are portable computers that you can take with you and use in
            different environments. They include a screen, keyboard, and a trackpad or trackball, which serves as the
            mouse. Because laptops are meant to be used on the go, they have a battery which allows them to operate
            without being plugged into a power outlet. Laptops also include a power adapter that allows them to use
            power from an outlet and recharges the battery.

            While portable computers used to be significantly slower and less capable than desktop computers, advances
            in manufacturing technology have enabled laptops to perform nearly as well as their desktop counterparts. In
            fact, high-end laptops often perform better than low or even mid-range desktop systems. Most laptops also
            include several I/O ports, such as USB ports, that allow standard keyboards and mice to be used with the
            laptop. Modern laptops often include a wireless networking adapter as well, allowing users to access the
            Internet without requiring any wires.

            While laptops can be powerful and convenient, the convenience often comes at a price. Most laptops cost
            several hundred dollars more than a similarly equipped desktop model with a monitor, keyboard, and mouse.
            Furthermore, working long hours on a laptop with a small screen and keyboard may be more fatiguing than
            working on a desktop system. Therefore, if portability is not a requirement for your computer, you may find
            better value in a desktop model.</h3>
